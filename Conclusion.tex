\label{ch:conc}

We have presented semantic equivalence rules for an extension of the choice calculus and sound operations for an implementation of variational lists.
The choice calculus is a calculus for describing variation and the formula choice calculus is an extension with formulas.
We have proven semantic equivalence rules for the formula choice calculus.
Variational lists are functional data structures for representing and computing with variation in lists using the choice calculus.
We have proven map and bind operations are sound for an implementation of variational lists.
