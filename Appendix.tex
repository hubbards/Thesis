\chapter{Formal Verification}
\label{app:coq}

In this appendix, we list verified proofs written in the language of the Coq proof assistant~\citep{BC04}.
The properties from \chref{cc} are verified in \appref{f-coq} and \appref{fcc-coq} and the source code is available online.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hubbards/fcc-coq}}
The properties from \chref{vp} are verified in \appref{vp-coq} and the source code is also available online.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hubbards/vp-coq}}

For simplicity, we use a non-generic map operation.
However, this is not a fundamental restriction.
We could use a generic map operation and the following proofs would not change since the logic does not depend on the list type parameter.
